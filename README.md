# rpi_exporter

A lightweight Prometheus exporter for Raspberry Pi hardware metrics.

Currently supports the following metrics from the VideoCore System-on-Chip:

- Component power states
- Clock rates
- Temperatures
- Voltages
- Turbo mode

`rpi_exporter` is written in Go, has no dependencies and does not rely on
`vcgencmd` to query hardware stats. It interfaces directly with the VideoCore
device so that metric-collection is as lightweight and fast as possible.
